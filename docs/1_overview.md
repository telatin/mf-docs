# Overview

## The pipeline


![MetaPhage Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link imgs/workflow.svg %})


## To get started

A complex pipeline requires a lot of dependencies and the appropriate resources 
to parallelize the execution of concurrent tasks.

Nextflow allows the user to have a custom configuration specifying how to execute the
tasks (locally, in a cluster, on the cloud) and where to find the packages (Singularity, Docker).

Finally, MetaPhage needs a set of databases that can be easily downloaded with a script provided 
in the repository.
